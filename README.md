## Project Overview

This project aims to build a web platform where users can view and interact with a collection of music tracks. The website is hosted on Netlify with continuous integration and deployment from a GitHub repository. The user interface is built using Vue.js.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Hosting/CI/CD**: Netlify, GitHub Actions
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Analytics**: Plausible Analytics
- **Audio Controls and Visualization**: Integrated using Web Audio API and additional libraries

## Features

- Audio playback controls (play, pause, stop, volume, etc.)
- Waveform visualization of audio tracks
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile users
- Analytics integration using Plausible for privacy-friendly visitor stats

## Hosting on Netlify

The website is hosted on Netlify, enabling automatic deployment whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository's main branch.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

GitHub Actions are configured to handle continuous integration, including automated testing and deployment in conjunction with Netlify.

## Audio Controls and Visualization

Audio playback and interaction are crucial features of this project. Vue.js provides a reactive framework that can be used in conjunction with the following:

- **Web Audio API**: This is a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. It can be used to add audio playback controls and to manipulate sound in complex ways.

- **Wavesurfer.js**: An open-source customizable waveform visualization built on top of the Web Audio API and HTML5 Canvas. It's perfect for adding visual feedback to the currently playing audio.

- **Howler.js**: An audio library that makes working with audio in JavaScript easy across all platforms.
