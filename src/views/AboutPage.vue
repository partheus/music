    <h4>What goes on...</h4>

    <p>This site is a project by me, Parth Shiralkar, also known as hTrap. It is a playground for me to experiment with
      Vue.js and stuff. The site is under construction and will be updated in several time units.</p>

    <p>It is also a place to showcase my music. All music on this site is created by me using a combination of
      an old Akai MIDI controller and Fruity Loops. I am not a professional musician, and I do not make a living from my
      music. I make music because it's thoroughly fun.</p>

    <p>Feel free to navigate to the
      <router-link to="/originals">Original Music</router-link>
      and
      <router-link to="/remixes">Remixes</router-link>
      pages to listen to some of my music. Volume control is available on all pages.
    </p>
